### Hi there 👋

My name is Andrea, and I am very passionate about development, technology and innovation.

I like to code for work, but I also love ❤️ coding for personal and hobby projects. I'm pretty proud of some of the things I was able to do with very good colleagues and friends in my career, but I also know that for every new thing I learn everyday there are many that I need to know about, understand better and get passioned about.

So, well, I'd better get going, see you online!🧑🏻‍💻
